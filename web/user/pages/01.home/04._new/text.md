## New to Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine?

If you're new to this healing tradition, you may have questions—about what to expect, how it works, and whether it's right for you. We’ll walk you through the process and ensure your experience is relaxing, informative, and empowering.

<details>
  <summary>Does acupuncture hurt?</summary>
  <div>Most people are surprised at how gentle acupuncture feels. The needles are very thin, about the width of a human hair, and are inserted with care. You might feel a slight pinch or tingling sensation, but many patients find treatments deeply relaxing, sometimes even drifting off to sleep during a session.</div>

<details>
  <summary>What conditions can acupuncture help with?</summary>
  <div>Acupuncture is used to support a wide range of health concerns, from pain relief (back, neck, headaches) to stress, anxiety, digestive issues, sleep problems, and women’s health. It works by restoring balance in the body’s energy systems, which helps your natural healing processes function more effectively.</div>

<details>
  <summary>How does Chinese medicine differ from Western medicine?</summary>
  <div>While Western medicine often focuses on treating specific symptoms or diseases, Chinese medicine takes a holistic approach, looking at the whole person—the body, emotions, lifestyle, and environment. Treatment plans are personalized and aim to restore harmony and balance, rather than only addressing isolated symptoms.</div>

<details>
  <summary>How many acupuncture sessions will I need?</summary>
  <div>That depends on your condition and overall health. Acute issues may improve in just a few visits, while chronic conditions often benefit from a series of treatments over time. Your practitioner will suggest a treatment plan tailored to your needs and goals, adjusting as your body responds.</div>

<details>
  <summary>Is acupuncture safe?</summary>
  <div>When performed by a licensed practitioner, acupuncture is very safe. The needles are sterile, single-use, and disposed of after each session. Side effects are rare and usually mild, such as slight bruising or temporary soreness at the needle site. Many patients find acupuncture a safe, natural complement to other forms of care.</div>
